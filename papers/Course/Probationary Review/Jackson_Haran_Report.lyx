Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common theme over the course of humanity's uncovering of the Laws of Physics
 has been the unification of mathematical descriptions of formerly apparently-di
sparate physical phenomena (for example Maxwell's equations in unifying
 the theories of electromagnetism and optics, or the proposed Grand Unified
 Theories of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions of the Standard
 Model).
 Computational Continuum Mechanics is yet to see ubiquitous adoption of
 such a unified framework, with separate models used to describe the various
 states of matter.
 These models differ not just in terms of the first-principles descriptions
 they posit for the materials that they purport to describe, but also in
 their mathematical characteristics.
 For example, the viscous stress terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are
 empirically derived, and the resulting system is parabolic in nature.
 By contrast, the Godunov-Romenski equations of elasto-plastic deformation
 of metals are based on a first-principles description of the microscopic
 material elements of the continuum, and the model is hyperbolic in nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unified models are not just aesthetically pleasing, but also practically
 useful.
 The conceptual work required to implement a computational simulation involving
 many different components is greatly reduced, saving time and allowing
 for greater specialization of computational techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of a multiphase system is slightly ambiguous in the literature.
 Here it will be taken to mean a system consisting of either two or more
 different materials (possibly in the same phase of matter), or two or more
 volumes of (possibly the same) material in different phases of matter.
 There are two aspects of multiphase systems that require attention: multiphase
 flow, and multiphase heat transfer.
 The latter becomes important when the phases are at different temperatures.
 In this study, the different phases will be assumed to be immiscible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a unified model of continuum mechanics, capable of describing all
 phases in the same framework, different sets of equations may have to be
 used in the different regions occupied by different phases.
 These systems arise, for example, in fluid-structure interaction, or oil-water
 interfaces.
 An overview of current approaches to multiphase systems will now be given.
 The examples here are illustrative but not exhaustive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There has been a huge amount of research activity in the field over the
 years, but current approaches can be broadly classified as either monolithic
 or partitioned 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hou2012"

\end_inset

.
 In a monolithic scheme, all phases are described by the same set of nonlinear
 equations.
 The evolution of the interfaces is implicit to the equations, unlike in
 partitioned schemes.
 See for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Michler2004,Hubner2004"

\end_inset

.
 The system is solved by a multivariate Newton-type method.
 It is often ill-conditioned, due to the different scales of the state variables
 of the different phases.
 Thus, iterative solvers are required, proving inefficient unless good precondit
ioners are available.
 Codes tend to be very specialized to the specific problems they solve,
 and it requires expertise to develop and maintain such methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a partitioned scheme, the states of the different phases are calculated
 separately at each time step, possibly using different models.
 See Rossi and Oñate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rossi2010"

\end_inset

 for a recent overview of some of the common algorithmic features of these
 schemes.
 The individual systems do not suffer from the scaling-induced conditioning
 problems of monolithic schemes, but attention now needs to be payed to
 the material interfaces.
 Modeling them can be unstable and relatively computationally expensive
 (although typically not as expensive as solving the full monolithic systems).
 One of the great benefits of partitioned schemes is that legacy implementations
 of common models may be used in the domains occupied by materials that
 they describe.
 These implementations are often well-used and relatively bug free, and
 tend to be written efficiently for the kinds of problems that the solve.
 As an example of a software suite taking advantage of this, see the Caltech's
 Virtual Test Facility

\begin_layout Standard
Under both types of schemes, the models describing the different phases
 may be formulated in either a Lagrangian, an Eulerian, or an ALE framework.
 Solids models tend to come in Lagrangian form, and often these are combined
 with ALE forms for the fluid phases, so that the fluid meshes may deform
 to match the deformation of the solid (see, for example, Pin et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pin2007"

\end_inset

).
 These schemes tend to be very accurate, but like all Lagrangian schemes,
 they fail if the meshes become highly contorted.
 Thus, adaptive remeshing is often necessary.
 Some authors have coupled a Lagrangian solid scheme with an Eulerian fluid
 scheme, but extra care must be taken when applying the boundary conditions
 to the interface, which corresponds to the intersection of the Eulerian
 and Lagrangian meshes (see Legay et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for an implementation using level sets, or Fedkiw 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 for a GFM coupling).
 Some authors, such as Ryzhakov et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ryzhakov2010"

\end_inset

, have found success in using the common Lagrangian formulations for the
 solid, and a reformulated Lagrangian model for the fluid, implementing
 the necessary adaptive remeshing.
 Yet another option is to model both the fluid and the solid in an Eulerian
 framework, although this now necessitates a level set method or volume
 of fluid method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hirt1981"

\end_inset

 to track the interfaces.
 Also, these methods are more prone to losing small-scale geometric features
 of the media, unless methods such as AMR are employed to combat this

\begin_layout Standard
In a recently submitted paper, Michael and Nikiforakis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 (building on the work of Schoch et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schoch2013"

\end_inset

) couple various Eulerian models of reactive and inert fluids and solids
 by use of a Riemann Ghost Fluid Method, with the ghost states calculated
 using specialised mixed-material Riemann solvers for each interaction (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Ghost Fluid Methods"

\end_inset

).
 Whilst these techniques do not suffer from the mesh contortion issues inherent
 in Lagrangian formulations of continuum mechanics, and the interface coupling
 tends to be less computationally expensive than the iterative techniques
 demanded by monolithic schemes, a fair amount of theoretical work needs
 to be done to derive analytical relations describing the interactions between
 every pair of models used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it were possible to describe all phases with the same Eulerian model,
 this method could be used, with only one type of Riemann solver needed
 to cope with any multiphase problem posed.
 This would effectively be a partitioned scheme with the same system solved
 in each domain.
 The GPR model represents such an opportunity.
 As will be seen, the model also includes terms for heat conduction, which
 do not appear in the basic formulations of many of the common models used
 in multiphase systems (e.g.
 the Euler equations, or the Navier-Stokes equations).
 Heat conduction is often ignored in multiphase modeling, but such a framework
 based on the GPR model would almost unavoidably include it.
 It should be noted, though, that any unified model of continuum mechanics
 purporting to describe all phases of interest must be at least as descriptive
 as competing models tailored to each individual phase if the utmost model
 fidelity is required.
 Although the results for the GPR model applied to standard test cases have
 been promising, both here and in other preliminary studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dumbser2016a,Boscheri2016"

\end_inset

, more work is required to determine how faithfully the GPR model reproduces
 common agreed phenomenological results.

The GPR model and Godunov and Romenski's 1970s model of elastoplastic deformatio
n in fact relie upon the same equations.
 The realization of Peshkov and Romenski was that these are the equations
 of motion for an arbitrary continuum - not just a solid - and so the model
 can be applied to fluids too.
 Unlike in previous continuum models, material elements have not only finite
 size, but also internal structure, encoded in the distortion tensor.

; the characteristic time taken for a particle to move by a distance of

 Thus,

 characterizes the time taken for a material element to rearrange with its
 neighbors.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}=\infty$
\end_inset

 for solids and

 the WENO method.
 This reconstruction is then extended to a reconstruction in both space
 and time for each individual cell in the domain, using the Discontinuous
 Galerkin method.
 A finite volume solver is then used to couple neighbouring cells and produce
 the cell-wise constant data at the next time step.
 In this study, all simulations were performed in 1D.
 The methods presented here are easily extensible to higher dimensions,
 however.

 probably more involved than necessary to perform the simulations in this

 The DG step in particular is relatively computationally taxing.
 The purpose of this study, however, was not to investigate more efficient
 solution methods for this particular system (see Sverdrup

The objective of my PhD project is to develop the GPR model in various specific
 ways so that it may be used to simulate the problems of impact-induced
 detonation of a combustible material in an elasto-plastic confiner.
 A graphical representation of this problem is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:ConfinedDetonation"

\end_inset

.
 As can be seen, three states of matter are present (a solid confiner, a
 liquid combustible confined material, and gaseous surrounding environment).
 The interfaces between these phases and the exchange of state information
 between them need to be dealt with in any numerical method employed.
 The GPR model must also be augmented in some way to capture the kinetics
 of the chemical reactions present.
 Up until now, ADER-WENO methods have been used to solve the GPR model (as
 described in paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:The-ADER-WENO-Method"

\end_inset

).
 Whilst these are able to provide arbirarily-high-order accuracy solutions
 in both space and time, they are too slow for the practical applications
 that we envisage in our lab, even at second-order accuracy; faster numerical
 solvers are needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, there are three main issues that I am addressing in my work:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$

 the interface lies between the cells with primitive variables

\begin_layout Standard
All cells in 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P^{\left(1\right)}}$

 All cells to the right have the same pressure and velocity as their counterpart
s in 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P^{n}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P_{i}^{n}}$
\end_inset

 This affects their density.
 The situation is analogous for 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P^{\left(2\right)}}$

 This is demonstrated in

\begin_inset Formula $k$

 Define:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{P_{j}^{n+1}}=\begin{cases}
\boldsymbol{P_{j}^{\left(1\right)}} & j\leq k\\
\boldsymbol{P_{j}^{\left(2\right)}} & j>k
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rationale behind the original GFM is that in most applications, pressure
 and velocity are continuous across the interface, and thus the ghost cells
 may take the real pressure and velocity values.
 Entropy is generally discontinuous at a contact discontinuity, resulting
 in large truncation errors if a standard finite difference scheme is used
 to solve the system.
 Thus, entropy is extrapolated as a constant from the interface boundary
 cell into the ghost region.

The solution of the Riemann Problem usually takes the form of a set of waves,
 between which 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P}$
\end_inset

 is constant.
 The waves can either be a contact discontinuity (across which pressure
 and velocity are continuous), a shock (across which all variables may be
 discontinuous), or a rarefaction (along which the variables vary continuously
 between their values on either side of the wave).
 The number and form of the waves are determined by the governing equations
 and the initial conditions.
 The states of the variables either side of the contact discontinuity in
 the middle are known as the

 This is because the method effectively solves two separate single-fluid
 Riemann problems.
 The waves present in these Riemann problems do not necessarily correspond
 to those in the real Riemann problem across the interface.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Owing to the similarity of the structure of the non-linear elasticity equations
 to those of the GPR model (differing only in the presence of source terms
 and the form of the shear stress tensor, and possibly the EOS), their method
 is built upon here.
 The resulting method is named

The Riemann Problem of the GPR model takes the form demonstrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:HPR_RP"

\end_inset

.
 Assuming all waves are distinct, there are four waves on either side of
 the contact discontinuity.
 On each side, one wave corresponds to the thermal impulse (manifesting
 as a heat wave) and the other three correspond to the distortion components
 in the axis in which the Riemann Problem is considered (manifesting as
 two shear waves and one longitudinal pressure wave).
 In the following the effect of the source terms on the solution to the
 RP is neglected.
 This is thought to be a reasonable assumption for the problem at hand,
 as only the star states are required, and the time step over which the
 RP is taken is very small.
 The method is presented here along the first spatial axis.
 It can easily be adapted along any axis.

It may be necessary to iterate this process a few times to ensure convergence
 to star states for which the boundary conditions hold.
 The convergence properties of this process are unknown, and there may be
 issues with stability and robustness.
 No significant issues were encountered in this study, however.

\begin_layout Paragraph
The Temperature Fix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the original GFM, the entropy in the ghost region is fixed to the value
 of the interface cell in the real region (or, in the case of the isobaric
 fix, the second cell away from the interface).
 This was found to be inadequate in problems in which heat conduction across
 the material interface was desired, as the temperature in the ghost region
 then takes on an unrealistic value.
 Thus, when modeling problems involving intermaterial heat conduction with
 the GPR-RGFM, the density in the ghost region was fixed by a temperature
 requirement, rather than an entropy requirement.
 If the temperatures of materials 1 and 2 were 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1},T_{2}$
\end_inset

 at the interface, the temperature in both of their ghost regions was set
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{ghost}=\frac{T_{1}+T_{2}}{2}$
\end_inset

; a simple, intuitive choice to make.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $p^{ghost}=p^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, when using a stiffened gas EOS, the ghost density for both fluids
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho^{ghost}=\frac{p^{*}+p_{\infty}}{\left(\gamma-1\right)c_{v}T^{ghost}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $K=L$

\end_inset

.
 To ensure condition

 is satisfied, the following transformation is required:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A_{K}^{*}\rightarrow\left(\frac{\rho^{ghost}}{\rho_{K}^{*}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}A_{K}^{*}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{ghost}=q_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 after the temperature fix, the following transformation is required:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin{equation}
J_{K}^{*}\rightarrow\frac{T_{K}^{*}}{T^{ghost}}J_{K}^{*}

Numerical Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GPR-RGFM is now assessed.
 The first three tests in this chapter are standard Riemann problems, exact
 solutions to which exist for the Euler equations.
 The viscosity of the GPR model smears the solutions in areas in which the
 solutions to the Euler equations are discontinuous or not smooth.
 This smearing is not the result of using a low-order solver (all results
 in these sections being calculated to third order).
 The last two tests assess the ability of the GPR-RGFM to correctly model
 heat conduction across interfaces, using the temperature fix described
 in

 The viscous smearing in the density and the

\end_inset

 in the velocity at the contact discontinuity are present, as investigated
 by Jameson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 When applying the GPR-RGFM, the contact discontinuity is now maintained,
 as it should be, as the gases are assumed to be immiscible.
 Additionally, the bump in the velocity is no longer present.
 This is correct, as the bump corresponds to a smearing of the density across
 the contact discontinuity, which should not occur for immiscible gases.

 In the former, the shock is about to hit the helium bubble (corresponding
 to the region of low density).
 In the latter, the shock has traveled through the helium bubble, compressing
 it slightly, and the bubble itself has moved almost 0.1 spatial units to
 the right.
 There is good correspondence with the results in

 The results for scenarios 1 and 2 are indistinguishable, as they should
 be, and there are no aberrations around the material interface in scenario
 2.
 In scenario 3, the acoustic wave hits the interface at around 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2\times10^{-9}$
\end_inset

 and then speeds up (as it should, the speed of sound in helium being around
 three times that of air).
 The heat flux wave increases in intensity after passing into the helium,
 owing to the fact that the wave is traveling faster.
 As expected, all variables displayed are continuous across the interface.

In scenarios 2 and 3 the interface moves to the right as the air heats up
 and expands.

The temperature curve generated using the GPR-RGFM matches very well the
 reference solution.
 The interface has moved to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.53756$
\end_inset

, as is to be expected, as the cooler gas on the left expands as it heats
 up, and the hotter gas on the right contracts as it cools.
 Initially, the mass of the left volume is 1 and the right volume is 0.25.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1$
\end_inset

, these masses are 0.9997 and 0.2503, respectively.
 Thus, mass on either side is conserved to a good approximation.
 Although the GPR-RGFM results for the heat flux match the reference solution
 well over most of the domain, there are aberrations in a small region around
 the interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temperature fix is crucial in obtaining these results.
 Using the traditional entropy fix instead results in a stationary system,
 with the initial conditions persisting indefinitely.
 This is because the entropy fix does not allow the system to

 the interface.

Note that heating the inert gas produces an acoustic wave of constant pressure,
 propagating ahead of the temperature curve.
 This pressure wave is also present in the heating of the combustible gas,
 where it proceeds in front of the combustion wave.
 The temperature increase accompanying this acoustic wave is not enough
 to ignite the reactive gas, and the thin reaction zone lags behind the
 acoustic wavefront.
 Although the combustion wave is referred to as a detonation wave in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, it would now commonly be called a deflagration wave, as it travels subsonicall
y and is not coincident with the shock wave.

It is now demonstrated that the heating-induced deflagration test can result
 in detonation if the temperature gradient upon ignition is less steep.
 This test is identical to the previous test, with one exception: 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 is given the higher value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{15}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the activation energy is effectively lower, or equivalently, the
 whole gas volume is relatively closer to the ignition temperature when
 the gas at the left boundary ignites.
 The results of this test are shown in

 Unlike in

, the system does not relax to the CJ state behind the detonation wave,
 as thermal energy is continually added to the reflective left boundary.
 The region behind the reaction zone is thus complex.

 However, these systems can also be solved separately, using the analytical

 This ODE system travels along the surface

\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=x_{3}$

 As such, given that the system is autonomous, the paths of evolution of
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 cannot cross the intersections of these planes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, any non-strict inequality of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\geq x_{j}\geq x_{k}$
\end_inset

 is maintained for the whole history of the system.
 By considering 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 it is clear that in this case 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is monotone decreasing, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$

 is monotone increasing, and the time derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$

 may switch sign.

Thus, an ODE solver can be used on these two equations to effectively solve

This has solution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

In the case that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i,0}=x_{j,0}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=x_{j}$
\end_inset

 for all time.
 Thus, the ODE system for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 has been reduced to a single ODE, as 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}\left(x_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

 can be inserted into the RHS of the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{dx_{i}}{d\tau}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
If any of the relations in

\end_inset

 are in fact equalities, equality is maintained throughout the history of
 the system.
 This can be seen by noting that the time derivatives of the equal variables
 are in this case equal.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}=x_{k}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=\frac{1}{x_{j}^{2}}$

As 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 is an autonomous system of ODEs, it has the property that its limit 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=x_{2}=x_{3}=1$
\end_inset

 is never obtained in finite time, in precise arithmetic.
 In floating point arithmetic we may say that the system has converged when
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}-1<\epsilon$
\end_inset

 (machine epsilon) for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 This happens when:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau>F_{2}\left(1+\epsilon;x_{i}^{0}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This provides a quick method to check whether it is necessary to run the
 ODE solver in a particular cell.
 If the following condition is satisfied then we know the system in that
 cell converges to the ground state over the time interval in which the
 ODE system is calculated:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{2}{\tau_{1}}\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_{0}}\right)^{\frac{7}{3}}\Delta t>F_{2}\left(1+\epsilon;\max\left\{ x_{i}^{0}\right\} \right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the fluid is very inviscid, resulting in a stiff ODE, the critical time
 is lower, and there is more chance that the ODE system in the cell reaches
 its limit in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 This check potentially saves a lot of computationally expensive stiff ODE
 solves.
 The same goes for if the flow is slow-moving, as the system will be closer
 to its ground state at the start of the time step and is more likely to
 converge over 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, if the following condition is satisfied then we know for sure
 that an ODE solver is necessary, as the system certainly will not have
 converged over the timestep:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{2}{\tau_{1}}\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_{0}}\right)^{\frac{7}{3}}\Delta t<F_{1}\left(1+\epsilon;\max\left\{ x_{i}^{0}\right\} \right)

Combining these equations, we have:

\begin_inset Formula

 At

 the Split-WENO method matches the curve of the velocity profile more closely,
 but overshoots slightly at the boundaries of the center region.
 This overshoot phenomenon is not visible in the ADER-WENO results.

Speed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the ADER-WENO scheme and the Split-WENO scheme used in this study were
 implemented in Python3.
 All array functions were precompiled with Numba's JIT capabilities and
 the root-finding procedure in the Galerkin predictor was performed using
 SciPy's Newton-Krylov solver, compiled against the Intel MKL.
 Clear differences in computational cost between the ADER-WENO and Split-WENO
 methods were apparent, as is to be expected, owing to the lack of Galerkin
 method in the Split-WENO scheme.
 The wall times for the various tests undertaken in this study are given
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:WallTimes"

\end_inset

, comparing the combined WENO and Galerkin methods of the ADER-WENO scheme
 to the combined WENO and ODE methods of the Split-WENO scheme.
 All computations were performed using an Intel Core i7-4910MQ, on a single
 core.
 The number of time steps taken are given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:TimeSteps"

\end_inset

.
 The differences between the methods in terms of the number of time steps
 taken in each test result from the fact that, for numerical stability,
 CFL numbers of 0.8 and 0.7 were required by the ADER-WENO method and the
 Split-WENO method, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, unlike with the ADER-WENO scheme, the wall time for the Split-WENO
 scheme is unaffected by a decrease in the viscosity in Stokes' First Problem
 (and the corresponding increase in the stiffness of the source terms).
 This is because the analytic approximation to the distortion ODEs obviates
 the need for a stiff solver.
 The large difference in ADER-WENO solver times between the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 cases is due to the fact that, in the latter case, a stiff solver must
 be employed for the initial guess to the root of the nonlinear system produced
 by the Discontinuous Galerkin method (as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hidalgo2011"

\begin_layout Standard
As long as a fluid under consideration is simple and a flow is laminar,
 the information about rotations of fluid particles stored in the distortion
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be ignored and, for example, the [Cauchy] deformation tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $G=A^{T}A$
\end_inset

 can be used as the state variable instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The situation becomes quite different if we consider complex fluids, e.g.,
 liquid crystals, where the orientation of particles plays an important
 role, and therefore, particle rotations cannot be ignored.
 One may expect that the same is true for turbulent flows of simple Newtonian
 fluid.

As 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 is symmetric positive definite, it has the following eigendecomposition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G=U\Lambda U^{T}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is orthonormal.
 Note that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G\dev\left(G\right)=U\Lambda U^{T}\left(U\Lambda U^{T}-\frac{\tr\left(U\Lambda U^{T}\right)}{3}I\right)=U\Lambda\dev\left(\Lambda\right)U^{T}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 becomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{U}\Lambda U^{T}+U\dot{\Lambda}U+U\Lambda\dot{U^{T}}+U\Lambda U^{T}\nabla\boldsymbol{v}+\nabla\boldsymbol{v}^{T}U\Lambda U^{T}=\frac{-2c_{s}^{2}}{\theta_{1}\left(\tau_{1}\right)}U\Lambda\dev\left(\Lambda\right)U^{T}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{X}$
\end_inset

 Therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U^{T}\dot{U}\Lambda+\dot{\Lambda}+\Lambda\dot{U^{T}}U+\Lambda U^{T}\nabla\boldsymbol{v}U+U^{T}\nabla\boldsymbol{v}^{T}U\Lambda=\frac{-2c_{s}^{2}}{\theta_{1}\left(\tau_{1}\right)}\Lambda\dev\left(\Lambda\right)\label{eq:ULU-Evolution}

Let

\begin_inset Formula $s^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$
\end_inset

) corresponding to the rotation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
 Then we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $s\dot{s}+x\dot{x}+y\dot{y}+z\dot{z}=0$
\end_inset

, it is straightforward to confirm that we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U^{T}\dot{U}\Lambda+\Lambda\dot{U^{T}}U=2\left(\begin{array}{ccc}

\left(s\dot{z}-z\dot{s}+y\dot{x}-x\dot{y}\right)\left(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}\right) & 0 & \left(s\dot{x}-x\dot{s}+z\dot{y}-y\dot{z}\right)\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{3}\right)\\
\left(s\dot{y}-y\dot{s}+x\dot{z}-z\dot{x}\right)\left(\lambda_{3}-\lambda_{1}\right) & \left(s\dot{x}-x\dot{s}+z\dot{y}-y\dot{z}\right)\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{3}\right) & 0

 The advantage of this is that the eigendecomposition of

 is readily calculated as part of the evolution of the system, rather than
 having to be calculated separately at each time step.

It should be noted that the right hand side of

\end_inset

 is undefined when 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}=\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 are not uniquely defined when one or more eigenvalues take the same value
 (as the corresponding eigenspaces have dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d>1$
\end_inset

).
 This issue is treated numerically by taking:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}}\approx\sign\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}}\right)\times\min\left(\left|\frac{1}{\lambda_{i}-\lambda_{j}}\right|,\Theta\right)\label{eq:1/(λi-λj)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 is a large number, less than or equal to the largest representable number
 available on the computational platform being used.

 The results of this test are presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 As can be seen, the obtained values for the eigenvalues exactly match those
 obtained with the original ODEs.
 Under the original formulation, as soon as the flow starts, the eigenvectors

snap

 to their constant values after the first time step.
 Under the new formulation, the eigenvectors relax to their true values
 in a continuous manner.
 The larger the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the faster this relaxation occurs, but the stiffer the ODEs that need

Outline for Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To restate the research objectives given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Research-Objectives"

\end_inset

, my PhD project consists of the following components:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To develop stable and accurate techniques to deal with the interfaces between
 different materials in multimaterial / multiphase problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To combine the GPR model with the models we use to describe the reactions
 of a combustible materials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To develop numerical methods for solving the GPR model in a reasonable amount
 of time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address each of these objectives one-by-one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As was seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Simulating-Material-Interfaces"

\end_inset

, I have developed a stable numerical method for dealing with material interface
s under the GPR model.
 This has only been tested in one dimension, however.
 It is well-know that in multiple dimensions issues with accuracy and stability
 can arise in ghost fluid methods and their accompanying methods of evolution
 of the position the interface (in this study, level set methods) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Desjardins2008,Terashima2009"

\end_inset

.
 This extension to multiple dimensions and consequent analysis remains to
 be done for the ghost fluid method I have developed, and I will also be
 comparing it with the more recent cut-cell methods (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Berger,Methods2011"

\end_inset

 for an overview), as they have been demonstrated to outperform ghost fluid
 methods in some situations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Although I have combined the GPR model with simple Arrhenius reaction kinetics
 terms, as seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Combining-the-GPR"

\end_inset

, there remains a great deal of work to incorporate more complicated reaction
 pathways (for example, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Romenski2010"

\end_inset

), and extra terms to keep track of the state information of both reactants
 and products (e.g.
 see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Michael2016"

\end_inset

).
 Although this should be straightforward, there may be unforseen difficulties
 in accomplishing this with the GPR model, and in any case this work will
 be time-consuming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:New-Numerical-Methods"

\end_inset

, I have developed a new numerical method for the GPR model that is significantl
y faster than the currently-available ADER-WENO methods (achieving over
 an order-of-magnitude speed-up on stiff test cases), but still able to
 attain second-order accurate solutions.
 The theoretical work I have presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:New-Numerical-Methods2"

\end_inset

 to improve further upon this method needs to be validated with further
 test cases, and I will perform this for the test cases presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:New-Numerical-Methods"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except in the case of unforseen difficulties in any of these noted extensions
 to the work I have already performed, it is reasonable to expect that I
 will be able to complete these tasks over the course of my second year,
 given the pace of my research output in my first year.
 My third year will consist of the full implementation and testing of these
 features in optimized C++ code, in a form compatible with my group's current
 codebase, and possible integration into this codebase, followed by full
 documentation in my doctoral thesis of all results obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it is difficult at this stage to judge exactly how long each of these
 stages may take, I note another possible extension of this work in the
 case that I have some spare time at the end of my course.
 The GPR model was recently modified to include magnetohydrodynamic effects
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dumbser"

\end_inset

 and the problem case given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Research-Objectives"

\end_inset

 could be extended in a form that necessitates this modification.
 For example, instead of inducing detonation in the combustible liquid by
 mechanical impact, it is possible to produce this effect by lighting strike
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "abdelal2017,chen2014"

\end_inset

 for similar to the problems).
 A fourth state of matter (plasma) can be incorporated into this problem.
 I do not expect to have time to perform this extension, and I will have
 fulfilled the requirements of my PhD project if I complete the tasks detailed
 that come before it.
 However its inclusion here guarantees that there will be no point at which
 I am without working needing to be performed.
