\begin_layout Abstract
The Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski model of continuum mechanics is claimed to
 be capable of describing both solids and fluids (both viscous and inviscid)
 in the same framework 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Peshkov2016,Dumbser2016a"

\end_inset

.
 Different solids and fluids are governed by the same set of partial differentia
l equations, differing only in their equations of states and strain dissipation
 functions.
 This has the potential to streamline development of simulation software
 for scenarios involving multiple materials and phases of matter, by reducing
 the number of different systems of equations that require solvers, and
 cutting down on the amount of theoretical work required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
At present, there is no way of dealing with material interfaces in the GPR
 model, however.
 In this study, a modification of Barton's

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is devised for the GPR model, enabling the simulation of material interfaces.
 This new method is tested on a variety of interface problems.
 It is demonstrated to accurately reproduce analytical results for known
 Riemann problems, and to produce expected results with regards to heat
 conduction across interfaces.

Multimaterial and Multiphase Models
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of a multiphase system is slightly ambiguous in the literature.
 Here it will be taken to mean a system consisting of either two or more
 different materials (possibly in the same phase of matter), or two or more
 volumes of (possibly the same) material in different phases of matter.
 There are two aspects of multiphase systems that require attention: multiphase
 flow, and multiphase heat transfer.
 The latter becomes important when the phases are at different temperatures.
 In this study, the different phases will be assumed to be immiscible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without a unified model of continuum mechanics, capable of describing all
 phases in the same framework, different sets of equations may have to be
 used in the different regions occupied by different phases.
 These systems arise, for example, in fluid-structure interaction, or oil-water
 interfaces.
 An overview of current approaches to multiphase systems will now be given.
 The examples here are illustrative but not exhaustive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There has been a huge amount of research activity in the field over the
 years, but current approaches can be broadly classified as either monolithic
 or partitioned 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hou2012"

\end_inset

.
 In a monolithic scheme, all phases are described by the same set of nonlinear
 equations.
 The evolution of the interfaces is implicit to the equations, unlike in
 partitioned schemes.
 See for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Michler2004,Hubner2004"

\end_inset

.
 The system is solved by a multivariate Newton-type method.
 It is often ill-conditioned, due to the different scales of the state variables
 of the different phases.
 Thus, iterative solvers are required, proving inefficient unless good precondit
ioners are available.
 Codes tend to be very specialized to the specific problems they solve,
 and it requires expertise to develop and maintain such methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a partitioned scheme, the states of the different phases are calculated
 separately at each time step, possibly using different models.
 See Rossi and Oñate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Rossi2010"

\end_inset

 for a recent overview of some of the common algorithmic features of these
 schemes.
 The individual systems do not suffer from the scaling-induced conditioning
 problems of monolithic schemes, but attention now needs to be payed to
 the material interfaces.
 Modeling them can be unstable and relatively computationally expensive
 (although typically not as expensive as solving the full monolithic systems).
 One of the great benefits of partitioned schemes is that legacy implementations
 of common models may be used in the domains occupied by materials that
 they describe.
 These implementations are often well-used and relatively bug free, and
 tend to be written efficiently for the kinds of problems that the solve.
 As an example of a software suite taking advantage of this, see the Caltech's
 Virtual Test Facility 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under both types of schemes, the models describing the different phases
 may be formulated in either a Lagrangian, an Eulerian, or an ALE framework.
 Solids models tend to come in Lagrangian form, and often these are combined
 with ALE forms for the fluid phases, so that the fluid meshes may deform
 to match the deformation of the solid (see, for example, Pin et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pin2007"

\end_inset

).
 These schemes tend to be very accurate, but like all Lagrangian schemes,
 they fail if the meshes become highly contorted.
 Thus, adaptive remeshing is often necessary.
 Some authors have coupled a Lagrangian solid scheme with an Eulerian fluid
 scheme, but extra care must be taken when applying the boundary conditions
 to the interface, which corresponds to the intersection of the Eulerian
 and Lagrangian meshes (see Legay et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Legay2006"

\end_inset

 for an implementation using level sets, or Fedkiw 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 for a GFM coupling).
 Some authors, such as Ryzhakov et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ryzhakov2010"

\end_inset

, have found success in using the common Lagrangian formulations for the
 solid, and a reformulated Lagrangian model for the fluid, implementing
 the necessary adaptive remeshing.
 Yet another option is to model both the fluid and the solid in an Eulerian
 framework, although this now necessitates a level set method or volume
 of fluid method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hirt1981"

\end_inset

 to track the interfaces.
 Also, these methods are more prone to losing small-scale geometric features
 of the media, unless methods such as AMR are employed to combat this 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a recently submitted paper, Michael and Nikiforakis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Michael"

\end_inset

 (building on the work of Schoch et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schoch2013"

\end_inset

) couple various Eulerian models of reactive and inert fluids and solids
 by use of a Riemann Ghost Fluid Method, with the ghost states calculated
 using specialised mixed-material Riemann solvers for each interaction (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Ghost Fluid Methods"

\end_inset

).
 Whilst these techniques do not suffer from the mesh contortion issues inherent
 in Lagrangian formulations of continuum mechanics, and the interface coupling
 tends to be less computationally expensive than the iterative techniques
 demanded by monolithic schemes, a fair amount of theoretical work needs
 to be done to derive analytical relations describing the interactions between
 every pair of models used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it were possible to describe all phases with the same Eulerian model,
 this method could be used, with only one type of Riemann solver needed
 to cope with any multiphase problem posed.
 This would effectively be a partitioned scheme with the same system solved
 in each domain.
 The GPR model represents such an opportunity.
 As will be seen, the model also includes terms for heat conduction, which
 do not appear in the basic formulations of many of the common models used
 in multiphase systems (e.g.
 the Euler equations, or the Navier-Stokes equations).
 Heat conduction is often ignored in multiphase modeling, but such a framework
 based on the GPR model would almost unavoidably include it.
 It should be noted, though, that any unified model of continuum mechanics
 purporting to describe all phases of interest must be at least as descriptive
 as competing models tailored to each individual phase if the utmost model
 fidelity is required.
 Although the results for the GPR model applied to standard test cases have
 been promising, both here and in other preliminary studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Dumbser2016a,Boscheri2016"

\end_inset

, more work is required to determine how faithfully the GPR model reproduces
 common agreed phenomenological results.

 The differences between the two models lie in the in the interpretation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rationale behind the original GFM is that in most applications, pressure
 and velocity are continuous across the interface, and thus the ghost cells
 may take the real pressure and velocity values.
 Entropy is generally discontinuous at a contact discontinuity, resulting
 in large truncation errors if a standard finite difference scheme is used
 to solve the system.
 Thus, entropy is extrapolated as a constant from the interface boundary
 cell into the ghost region.

The Riemann Problem in its general form is the solution of the following
 initial value problem.
 Given a set of variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P}$
\end_inset

 dependent on space and time, and a hyperbolic set of equations which govern
 their spatio-temporal evolution, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P}\left(x,t\right)$
\end_inset

 is sought for 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{P}\left(x,0\right)=\begin{cases}
\boldsymbol{P_{L}} & x<0\\
\boldsymbol{P_{R}} & x>0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $RP\left(\boldsymbol{P_{L}},\boldsymbol{P_{R}}\right)$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution of the Riemann Problem usually takes the form of a set of waves,
 between which 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{P}$
\end_inset

 is constant.
 The waves can either be a contact discontinuity (across which pressure
 and velocity are continuous), a shock (across which all variables may be
 discontinuous), or a rarefaction (along which the variables vary continuously
 between their values on either side of the wave).
 The number and form of the waves are determined by the governing equations
 and the initial conditions.
 The states of the variables either side of the contact discontinuity in
 the middle are known as the 
\shape italic
star states

 interfaces.
 This is because the method effectively solves two separate single-fluid
 Riemann problems.
 The waves present in these Riemann problems do not necessarily correspond
 to those in the real Riemann problem across the interface.

Barton et al.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Owing to the similarity of the structure of the non-linear elasticity equations
 to those of the GPR model (differing only in the presence of source terms
 and the form of the shear stress tensor, and possibly the EOS), their method
 is built upon here.
 The resulting method is named

The Riemann Problem of the GPR model takes the form demonstrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:HPR_RP"

\end_inset

.
 Assuming all waves are distinct, there are four waves on either side of
 the contact discontinuity.
 On each side, one wave corresponds to the thermal impulse (manifesting
 as a heat wave) and the other three correspond to the distortion components
 in the axis in which the Riemann Problem is considered (manifesting as
 two shear waves and one longitudinal pressure wave).
 In the following the effect of the source terms on the solution to the
 RP is neglected.
 This is thought to be a reasonable assumption for the problem at hand,
 as only the star states are required, and the time step over which the
 RP is taken is very small.
 The method is presented here along the first spatial axis.
 It can easily be adapted along any axis.

The GPR-RGFM is now assessed.
 The first two tests in this chapter are standard Riemann problems, exact
 solutions to which exist for the Euler equations.
 The viscosity of the GPR model smears the solutions in areas in which the
 solutions to the Euler equations are discontinuous or not smooth.
 This smearing is not the result of using a low-order solver (all results
 in these sections being calculated to third order).
 The last two tests assess the ability of the GPR-RGFM to correctly model
 heat conduction across interfaces.

 In the former, the shock is about to hit the helium bubble (corresponding
 to the region of low density).
 In the latter, the shock has traveled through the helium bubble, compressing
 it slightly, and the bubble itself has moved almost 0.1 spatial units to
 the right.
 There is good correspondence with the results in

\begin_layout Standard
The temperature curve generated using the GPR-RGFM matches very well the
 reference solution.
 The interface has moved to 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.53756$
\end_inset

, as is to be expected, as the cooler gas on the left expands as it heats
 up, and the hotter gas on the right contracts as it cools.
 Initially, the mass of the left volume is 1 and the right volume is 0.25.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1$
\end_inset

, these masses are 0.9997 and 0.2503, respectively.
 Thus, mass on either side is conserved to a good approximation.
 Although the GPR-RGFM results for the heat flux match the reference solution
 well over most of the domain, there are aberrations in a small region around
 the interface.
 Although this doesn't affect the temperature curve, these discrepancies
 are undesirable, and possible methods to rectify them are discussed in

As the left wall heats up, a temperature gradient develops and the acoustic
 wave described appears.
 The results for scenarios 1 and 2 are indistinguishable, as they should
 be, and there are no aberrations around the material interface in scenario
 2.
 In scenario 3, the acoustic wave hits the interface at around 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2\times10^{-9}$
\end_inset

 and then speeds up (as it should, the speed of sound in helium being around
 three times that of air).
 The heat flux wave increases in intensity after passing into the helium,
 owing to the fact that the wave is traveling faster.
 As expected, all variables displayed are continuous across the interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In scenarios 2 and 3 the interface moves to the right as the air heats up
 and expands.
 The masses of the air volumes in these two scenarios at various times are
 given in

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this study, the various fluids have been assumed to be immiscible.
 Whilst this is a common assumption in situations where mixing is low or
 practically non-existent, there are many problems which may require it.
 It should be fairly straightforward to implement a mixture model such as
 that proposed by Romenski et al.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Riemann Ghost Fluid Method presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:An HPR Riemann Ghost Fluid Method"

\end_inset

 has been demonstrated to be a viable way of accurately simulating the interface
s between different materials described by the GPR model.
 Unlike in many existing implementations, heat conduction across the interface
 was simulated accurately.
 This greatly simplifies the conceptual framework required for multiphase
 interactions, as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Multiphase-Systems"

\end_inset

.
 Implementation should be easier and quicker, and future work can be more
 focused on a single model, rather than several fundamentally different
 frameworks.

 If this is the case, higher order terms of the expansion can be neglected.
 If it is not, however, the method may fail.

The linearised nature of the GPR-RGFM solver also implicitly assumes that
 all waves of interest present in the Riemann Problem are shocks.
 Thus, strong rarefactions may cause the method to fail.
 An example of this is the failure of the GPR-RGFM on the water-gas shock
 tube test (taken from

An obvious improvement to the GPR-RGFM method presented would be to use
 a better Riemann solver than the iterative, linearised solver devised in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:An HPR Riemann Ghost Fluid Method"

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 be the matrix of left eigenvectors of the primitive system.
 As noted previously, the solver relies upon the fact that each of the following
 relations holds along the characteristic to which it corresponds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L\cdot\frac{d\boldsymbol{P}}{dt}=L\cdot\boldsymbol{S}\label{eq:along-characteristics}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
It may be that some numerical method is required to integrate 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 from the left and right interface boundary states to their respective star
 states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, a completely different approximate Riemann solver could be
 employed, such as the universal HLLEM solver of Dumbser et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dumbser2016"

\end_inset

.
 This path-conservative formulation of the HLLEM solver works for general
 non-conservative systems (such as the GPR model) and is simple to implement.
 It's based upon a new path-conservative HLL method (building on the original
 method of Harten, Lax, and van Leer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Harten1983"

\end_inset

) but is claimed to be able to represent linearly degenerate intermediate
 waves 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with a minimum of smearing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by evaluating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the intermediate characterist
ic fields (given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Eigenstructure of the HPR Model"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are iterative exact Riemann solvers for the equations of non-linear
 elasticity (to which the GPR model reduces as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

).
 Thus, they will work for applications of the GPR model to solids problems
 (and perhaps to very viscous fluids problems too).
 Although these solvers are computationally expensive, they are only used
 once at each material interface point at each time step, and thus the added
 accuracy that they provide may be desirable.
 There are two ways to formulate the equations of non-linear elasticity:
 one in which the deformation tensor (the analogue of the inverse of the
 GPR model's distortion tensor) is evolved in time, and one in which its
 inverse (the analogue of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) is evolved instead.
 Miller's exact solver 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Miller2004"

\end_inset

 uses the first formulation and the solver of Barton et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Barton2009"

\end_inset

 uses the second.
 The former can be used to evolve 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

, from which 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be calculated.
 Unfortunately, both solvers critically assume that the source terms of
 the system vanish, and so are unlikely to produce the correct boundary
 conditions for the GPR-RGFM when modeling relatively inviscid fluids.
 It should also be noted that they cannot be used for problems involving
 heat conduction across material interfaces, and they do not take the thermal
 conduction subsystem of the GPR model into account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a different EOS is used in order to model solids or other kinds of fluids,
 the derivations of the primitive systems matrices of the GPR model (given
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Appendix"

\end_inset

) will have to be performed again for each EOS, and the form of the eigenvectors
 will change (along with the systems solved to obtain the linearised approximati
ons to the star states for use in the GPR-RGFM).
 Although this is tedious, it is a relatively straightforward derivation
 to perform.
